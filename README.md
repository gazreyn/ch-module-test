# CastHub Module Boilerplate

This Boilerplate is a great place to start for more advanced Modules or for those who'd like to split their Modules in to separate files and use a build process. It provides:

- Typescript support
- External SCSS/CSS support
- Module bundling via Webpack
- Automatic uploading & publishing to CastHub

Be sure to check out our [Developer Documentation](https://docs.casthub.app)

## Building

```
yarn build # Builds the Module for Production
yarn dev # Watches for changes and builds for Development
```
